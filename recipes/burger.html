        <li>Ground chuck</li>
        <li>Crushed crackers or Panko bread crumbs</li>

    <h3>
        STEPS
    </h3>

    <ol>
        <li>set out a large mixing bowl and add in the ground beef, crushed crackers, egg, Worcestershire sauce, milk, and spices. Use your hands to combine until the mixture is very smooth thoroughly.</li>
        <li>press the meat down in the bowl, into an even disk. Use a knife to cut and divide the hamburger patty mixture into 6-1/3 pound grill or skillet patties, or 12 thin griddle patties</li>
        <li>preheat the grill or a skillet to medium heat, approximately 350-400 degrees F. I love using a cast-iron skillet for getting that drool-worthy caramelized sear on the burgers</li>
        <li>Homemade cooked hamburger patties will keep well tightly wrapped in plastic wrap, or in an airtight container, in the fridge for up to 3 days, or in the freezer for up to 3 months.</li>
        <li>serve with em juices</li>
    </ol>
